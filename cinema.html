<p>I created an AirBnb application using Java. This program loads the available properties and the information from a csv file. The users can select what price range they would like. They then see the map pane, which when you hover over the different boroughs shows how many properties are available. The colours of the text are colour coded in a way such that the borough with the fewest number of properties is dark red and the borough with the most number of properties is bright green. They can select on a borough which opens a drop down list of the properties available in that borough. Users can favourite a property by clicking the favourite button. Users can also see statistics about the properties and they can also see the location of it through google maps. Finally users can book any of the favourited properties through the booking pane, where they enter the dates they want to book it for, and a confirmation ticket is displayed.</p>
